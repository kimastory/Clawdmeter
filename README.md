# Clawdmeter

A small ESP32 dashboard I made for my desk to keep an eye on Claude Code usage.

It runs on a [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-2.16.htm?&aff_id=149786) and pairs with my laptop over Bluetooth, the splash screen plays pixel-art Clawd animations that get
busier when your usage rate climbs. The two side buttons send Space and
Shift+Tab over BLE HID for Claude Code's voice mode and mode-toggle shortcuts.

The Clawd animations come from [claudepix](https://claudepix.vercel.app), [@amaanbuilds](https://x.com/amaanbuilds)'s library of pixel-art Clawd sprites, check it out, it's lovely.

## M5Stack Core2 info panel

A standalone build for the [M5Stack Core2](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/core2) (320×240 ILI9342C).
Unlike the usage meter, it talks straight to the internet — there is no companion
daemon, no Bluetooth pairing and no Claude token involved. Plug it into any USB
charger and it works.

Three screens auto-cycle every 15 s:

| Screen    | Contents                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CLOCK** | Big clock + Korean calendar, with pixel-art dog and cat companions              |
| **INFO**  | Current/feels-like temp, daily high–low, humidity, precipitation chance, PM2.5 / PM10 / US AQI |
| **STOCK** | Ticker name, live price, trend chart, and gain/loss against your avg-buy price  |

Data sources: [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) forecast + air-quality APIs
(no API key needed), Yahoo Finance `query1` chart endpoint for the ticker, and
NTP (`pool.ntp.org`, `time.google.com`, `time.cloudflare.com`) for the clock.

### Configure

Copy the example header and fill it in — `wifi_config.h` is git-ignored, so your
credentials never get committed:

```bash
cp firmware/src/wifi_config.example.h firmware/src/wifi_config.h
$EDITOR firmware/src/wifi_config.h
```

At minimum set `CLAWDMETER_WIFI_SSID` and `CLAWDMETER_WIFI_PASS`. The info panel
also reads `CLAWDMETER_LAT` / `CLAWDMETER_LON` (weather + air-quality location),
`CLAWDMETER_TZ` (POSIX timezone, defaults to Seoul/KST), and the optional
`CLAWDMETER_STOCK_*` values for the ticker screen. `CLAWDMETER_USAGE_URL` is
ignored by this build.

### Build and flash

```bash
pio run -d firmware -e m5stack_core2_info -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX
```

The Core2 shows up as a CP2104 (`/dev/cu.usbserial-*` on macOS). The two Core2
builds are:

| Environment            | What it does                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `m5stack_core2_info`   | Standalone WiFi info panel (this section)                    |
| `m5stack_core2_aws`    | Original Claude-usage meter, fed over BLE or WiFi HTTP       |

### Buttons

| Button   | Function                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **BtnA** | Cycle the pet animation                     |
| **BtnB** | Next screen (the PWR key does the same)     |
| **BtnC** | Unused in this build                        |

The HID keyboard passthrough (Space / Shift+Tab) is deliberately absent here —
there is no BLE in the info-panel build at all.

### QA screenshots

The firmware can dump its framebuffer over USB serial, which is how the
screenshots in `screenshots/` were captured:

```bash
./screenshot-core2.sh out.png /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX
```

Or drive it directly over the serial monitor: `screenshot` grabs the current
screen, and `scr N` jumps to screen N (0 = clock, 1 = info, 2 = stock) so you can
capture each one deterministically. Conversion from RGB565 to PNG needs `ffmpeg`,
and the capture script needs `pyserial`.

**Note:** opening the CP2104 port normally resets the ESP32. `screenshot-core2.sh`
pulls DTR/RTS low *before* opening the port specifically to avoid that, so
whatever is on screen survives the capture.

### Korean fonts

The info panel renders Korean, which the upstream ASCII-only fonts can't do.
`tools/gen_kr_fonts.sh` generates subsetted [Pretendard](https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard)
LVGL fonts containing only the glyphs the UI actually draws (plus ASCII and the
degree sign, so temperatures render as `25°`), which keeps each font small:

```bash
./tools/gen_kr_fonts.sh    # needs npx + Pretendard OTFs in ~/Library/Fonts
```

Re-run it after adding any new Korean string to the UI, otherwise the new glyphs
render blank.

## Screens

The device boots into the splash and stays there until you press the middle (PWR) button, which cycles between Usage and Bluetooth. Tap the screen anywhere (except the Reset zone on the Bluetooth screen) to flip back to the splash; tap again to dismiss it.

|              Splash               |              Usage              |                Bluetooth                |
| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
| ![Splash](screenshots/splash.png) | ![Usage](screenshots/usage.png) | ![Bluetooth](screenshots/bluetooth.png) |
|   Splash; touch-toggle anytime    | Session and weekly utilization  |    Connection status and bond reset     |

While the splash is up, the middle button cycles animations instead of screens. The firmware also auto-rotates every 20 s within the current usage-rate group, so a long stretch on the splash isn't just one Clawd on loop.

## Hardware

- [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-2.16.htm?&aff_id=149786) - ESP32-S3R8, 2.16" 480×480 AMOLED (CO5300 QSPI), CST9220 cap touch, AXP2101 PMU + Li-Po battery, QMI8658 IMU
- USB-C cable for flashing firmware and charging
- 3.7V Li-Po battery (MX1.25 2-pin connector, optional)

## Prerequisites

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu) or macOS
- [PlatformIO CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html)
- Linux: `curl`, `bluetoothctl`, `busctl` (BlueZ Bluetooth stack)
- macOS: `python3` (the installer sets up a venv with `bleak` and `httpx`)
- Claude Code with an active subscription

## macOS installation

The macOS host pieces — Python daemon, LaunchAgent, and flash helper — were ported by [Chris Davidson (@lorddavidson)](https://github.com/lorddavidson). Thanks Chris!

### Flash the firmware

```bash
./flash-mac.sh                       # auto-detects /dev/cu.usbmodem*
./flash-mac.sh /dev/cu.usbmodem1101  # or pass an explicit USB serial port
```

### Pair the device

After flashing, open **System Settings → Bluetooth** and click *Connect* next to "Clawdmeter". The daemon will discover it on its next scan (~30 s).

### Install the daemon

The daemon reads your Claude OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`), polls usage every 60 s, and pushes it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install-mac.sh
```

The installer creates a Python venv in `daemon/.venv/`, installs `bleak` and `httpx`, renders a LaunchAgent into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist`, and loads it. The first run is launched interactively so macOS prompts for Bluetooth permission.

Useful commands:

```bash
launchctl list | grep claude-usage                                          # check it's running
tail -F ~/Library/Logs/claude-usage-daemon.out.log                          # live logs
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist  # stop
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist # start
```

## Linux installation

### Flash the firmware

```bash
cd firmware
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyACM0
```

### Pair the device

After flashing, the device advertises as "Claudemeter". Pair it once:

```bash
# Scan for the device
bluetoothctl scan le

# When "Claude Controller" appears, pair and trust it
bluetoothctl pair F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5    # use your device's MAC
bluetoothctl trust F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5
```

The MAC address is shown on the Bluetooth screen — press the middle (PWR) button to cycle to it.

### Install the daemon

The daemon polls your Claude usage every 60 seconds and sends it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install.sh
systemctl --user start claude-usage-daemon
```

Check status: `systemctl --user status claude-usage-daemon`

View logs: `journalctl --user -u claude-usage-daemon -f`

## How it works

1. The daemon reads your Claude Code OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
2. It makes a minimal API call to `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` — one token of Haiku, basically free.
3. The usage numbers come straight out of the response headers (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization` and friends).
4. The daemon connects to the ESP32 over BLE and writes a JSON payload to the GATT RX characteristic.
5. The firmware parses it and updates the LVGL dashboard.
6. The firmware also tracks the rate of change of session % over a 5-minute window and picks splash animations from the matching mood group.
7. The two side buttons are independent of all of this — they send Space and Shift+Tab as BLE HID keyboard input to the paired host directly.

## Physical buttons

The board has three side buttons. Left and right do the same thing on every screen; the middle button is screen-aware.

| Button           | GPIO         | Function                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Left**         | GPIO 0       | Hold to send Space (Claude Code voice-mode push-to-talk)       |
| **Middle** (PWR) | AXP2101 PKEY | Cycle screens (Usage ↔ Bluetooth); on splash, cycle animations |
| **Right**        | GPIO 18      | Press to send Shift+Tab (Claude Code mode toggle)              |

Space and Shift+Tab go out as standard BLE HID keyboard reports, so they trigger in whatever window has focus on the paired host — not just Claude Code.

## BLE protocol

The device advertises a custom GATT service alongside the standard HID keyboard service:

|                            | UUID                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Service**           | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000001` |
| RX Characteristic (write)  | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000002` |
| TX Characteristic (notify) | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000003` |
| **HID Service**            | `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

JSON payload format (written to RX):

```json
{ "s": 45, "sr": 120, "w": 28, "wr": 7200, "st": "allowed", "ok": true }
```

Fields: `s` = session %, `sr` = session reset (minutes), `w` = weekly %, `wr` = weekly reset (minutes), `st` = status, `ok` = success flag.

## Recompiling fonts

The `firmware/src/font_*.c` files are pre-compiled LVGL bitmap fonts.

```bash
npm install -g lv_font_conv
```

Generate each one (one at a time — `lv_font_conv` doesn't like loop-driven invocations) with `--no-compress` (required for LVGL 9):

```bash
# Tiempos Text (titles, 56px)
lv_font_conv --font assets/TiemposText-400-Regular.otf -r 0x20-0x7E \
  --size 56 --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
  -o firmware/src/font_tiempos_56.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"

# Styrene B (large numbers 48, panel labels 28, small text 24, minimal 20)
for size in 48 28 24 20; do
  lv_font_conv --font assets/StyreneB-Regular.otf -r 0x20-0x7E \
    --size $size --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
    -o firmware/src/font_styrene_${size}.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"
done

# DejaVu Sans Mono (32px, with spinner Unicode chars)
lv_font_conv --font assets/DejaVuSansMono.ttf \
  -r 0x20-0x7E,0xB7,0x2026,0x2722,0x2733,0x2736,0x273B,0x273D \
  --size 32 --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
  -o firmware/src/font_mono_32.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"
```

**Important:** `lv_font_conv` v1.5.3 outputs LVGL 8 format. Each generated file must be patched for LVGL 9 compatibility:

1. Remove `#if LVGL_VERSION_MAJOR >= 8` guards around `font_dsc` and the font struct
2. Remove the `.cache` field from `font_dsc`
3. Add `.release_glyph = NULL`, `.kerning = 0`, `.static_bitmap = 0` to the font struct
4. Add `.fallback = NULL`, `.user_data = NULL` to the font struct

Without these patches, fonts compile but render as invisible.

## Converting Lucide icons

The UI uses a small set of [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons (bluetooth + battery states) converted to RGB565 / RGB565A8 C arrays for LVGL.

```bash
node tools/png_to_lvgl.js assets/icon_bluetooth_48.png icon_bluetooth_data ICON_BLUETOOTH_WIDTH ICON_BLUETOOTH_HEIGHT
```

Default tint is white (`0xFFFFFF`); Lucide PNGs ship as black-on-transparent and would render invisible against the dark UI without it. Pass `--no-tint` for pre-coloured artwork like the logo. Battery icons use RGB565A8 (alpha plane) so they blend cleanly over the splash; the rest are baked RGB565 over the panel colour. Paste the converter output into `firmware/src/icons.h`.

## Splash animations

The animations come from [claudepix.vercel.app](https://claudepix.vercel.app),
a library of Clawd sprites. `tools/scrape_claudepix.js` evaluates the
site's JavaScript in a Node VM to pull out frame data and palettes, then
`tools/convert_to_c.js` turns everything into RGB565 C arrays and writes
`firmware/src/splash_animations.h`.

To re-pull (e.g. when the source library updates):

```bash
node tools/scrape_claudepix.js
node tools/convert_to_c.js
pio run -d firmware -t upload
```

See `tools/README.md` for details.
